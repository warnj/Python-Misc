It will be a fun day of diving complemented by delicious food! Our intended dive sites are KVI Tower and Maury Island Barges. KVI Tower's most popular site consists of a series of cement columns and rocks that make up the primary reef directly in from of the orange tower. They are covered with plumose anemones and swarmed with rock fish, perch, sculpin, greenling, etc. The structure is beautiful and reaches from approximately 30ft to 110ft with some boulders scattered up as far as 15ft on a low tide. About 50 yards away to the South is another finger of boulders that extends from about 60ft to 120ft. The reef extends on a steep sloping bottom that gets deep rapidly. The shallows are covered in eel grass and sea lettuce and house all sorts of small creatures such as gunnels and sole and make a great spot for safety stops. Visibility tends to be good and current is usually mild. Maury Island Barges has chunks of the original barges still intact creating hiding places for perch, lingcod and rockfish. You will usually see quite a few kelp greenling and ratfish here as well. We have also seen dogfish and the occasional sea lion! The barges intersect so you can easily swim from the remains of one barge to the others. Max depth is about 80' at the stern of the deepest barge. You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB). To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes (or somewhere close to it) from your tank. To sign up - sign up on Meetup, then go immediately to the Sea Ya Diving website www.seayadivingWA.com to pay for and reserve your spot ($85)."

This boat, which previously operated in the Hood Canal, is now ably run from North Tacom by Jamie and Karen Spink. And what a fun day of diving you will have! Accompanied by delicious food options both before and after your dives....fresh fruit, hot soup/stew and other goodies including hot beverages. As noted in ""The Perfect Dive"" website, Point Defiance North Wall is an advanced dive, near Owen Beach at Point Defiance in Tacoma. It boasts tall clay walls, dropping from 30’ at the top to 60-80’ at the base and is relatively sheltered from incoming tides (in other words it is divable during a low to moderate floods). The face of the wall is riddled with clam holes that have marred the face so that very little of the current swept wall is smooth. These holes make great homes for small creatures like nudibranchs, scallops and sculpin, while sea stars cling to the surface in search of their next meal. Rockfish and schools of perch swim in and out of the crevices. Sunrise Beach Reef is also an advanced dive due to potential currents. The main attraction of this site are the wolf eels tucked neatly in many of the holes found in the wall structure. There are many other species of sea life here as well including giant octopus. The wall is a series of large rock structures full of crevices, caves and boulders. It is a very beautiful, 3 dimensional dive…that is if you can look away from the wolf eels long enough to enjoy it! To get on this charter, first sign up on Meetup, then IMMEDIATELY go to the Sea Ya Diving website www.seaydivingWA.com to pay for your spots ($85). You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB).

Poke around the structures and look for critters in the crevices, or look up at the schooling rockfish. There is always something to see in these sites. Alki Fishing Reef is an artificial series of rock reefs created to encourage the attraction of fish and other marine life. There are 14 piles of concrete and rock debris that provide great structure for marine habitat set in patterns parallel to shore with depths between 40′ to 80′. Blake Island Reef is composed of concrete slabs, boxes, and other debris to encourage the attraction of marine life. These were barged in and deposited on a sandy/silt sea floor ranging in depths of 40′ to 100′ plus. The structures generally run parallel to the shore of Blake Island and are spread over a considerable distance. You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB). To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes (or somewhere close to it) from your tank. Ocean Quest provides coffee, tea, water as well as sandwiches and hot soup for lunch and delicious post-final-dive cookies! Bring all your gear, including two full tanks. As soon as you sign up on Meetup go immediately to the Ocean Quest website to pay ($90) to reserve your spot. Payment to Ocean Quest is the only way to confirm your place on the boat.

Features Wall, Boulder Pile / Shelves, Kelp Forest Description From the entry point, swim southwest toward the point of a relatively barren sandy bottom which turns to eel grass as you approach the point. Drop down when you reach the beginning of the point (just past the house with the bulkhead and where the steep cliff is on the shore) and follow the contour down and west as the slope becomes more prominent and turns into a series of ledges and then develops into a cascading wall covered in life. During summer months there will be kelp marking the wall so you can descend when you reach the barrier of kelp. The wall cascades down to about 85’ and is comprised of a series of steep shelves, overhangs and large rocks. Life covers nearly every surface of the wall and ledges LOTS of cucumbers and Giant Barnacles cover everything, huge urchins, sponges, GPOs, Puget Sound King Crab, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod, all sorts of perch and rockfish, etc. As you continue west it will become less gradual and you round the point. Come up over 40’ and ride the current back. The shallow section is just as interesting and dynamic as the deeper portions of the wall. Below the bottom of the wall the rock structure gives way to a steep sandy bottom. Special Restrictions: Beware of heavy currents. ONLY dive this site on slack before an ebb current (slack at high tide) or you will be fighting current both directions. Hop into the water about 30 minutes before slack and drift along the wall staying below 45’ on your way out. When you hit the end of the wall (it will start to turn into a slope and not so rocky) or when you are ready to turnaround, head up above 40’ and the current will bring you back toward the entry point. How to get there: From I-5 take exit 230 onto Highway 20 West toward Anacortes. Go all the way through Anacortes toward the Washington State Ferry Terminal. Hwy 20 will turn into Commercial Ave, then 12th, then Oaks just before the terminal. Take a left on Sunset Ave, then left onto Skyline Way, then right onto Cabana Way. Park at the end of the street past the marina on the beach side of the road. There is beach access just before the gate at the end of the road that leads to a house that sits on the water."

Last time I was here, we spotted several octopuses, at least one of which was a juvenile GPO that we got to play with for several minutes. This site always has something to see. For newer divers it is an easy dive site with many things above 60ft. Have working Primary and secondary dive lights. Tank light recommended. There are no changing rooms or restrooms at this location. After the dive, I plan to swing by Eight Diving in Des Moines to drop off my tanks.

"Sat, Aug 4, 2018, 10:00 AM",Whibey Island Dive,Keystone Jetty,"12900 Hwy 20 · Coupville, WA","Current predictions seem adequate for a dive at Keystone Jetty, pilings, and points in between (sea-floor hauserline). Come for a one or a two-tank dive! The visiting all three locations gives a good taste of different kinds of life. Today's first dive is at slack before ebb at 11:23am (1 knot flood to a 1.5 knot ebb). Second dive can probably be done between 12:40 and up to 5:20pm when second slack occurs (before a 1.1 knot flood). There is a restaurant across the parking lot for a meal, but it's summer time so consider bringing a bag lunch. Discovery Passes are required. Plenty of parking, bathroom facilities, and shower are available. Meet at 10am, splash at 11:00 for a 50 minute long dive. Actual splash time varies with your expected bottom time. Adjusted slack for that day is around 11:23am and 5:20pm. Mukilteo-Clinton ferry times: 20 min crossing time, plan for the 9am ferry or arrive earlier. Drive time from Clinton to Keystone Jetty is approximately 20 minutes. Ferry schedule found here: http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/pdf/2018Summer.pdf"
"Sat, Aug 4, 2018, 8:30 AM",Ocean Quest Weekend Boat Charter,Ocean Quest Dive Charters - Des Moines Marina,"22307 Dock Ave S. · Des Moines, WA","For those who work during the popular weekday charters, this one's for you! Join fellow Marker Buoy members for a 2 tank weekend charter to to the South Sound. SUNRISE: The premier of natural underwater reef structures. This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction. POINT DEFIANCE NORTH WALL: This gentle sloping wall consists of sandstone and rock structures beginning at 20′ and generally running down to 70-100′ but most divers choose to stay 70′ or more shallow. Clams that bore horizontal into the wall have made thousands of holes that have become homes for a great deal of marine life. Although this area has octopus and larger fish, most divers admire it for the structure it provides. Please RSVP on this site, then make your $90 payment directly to Ocean Quest at http://oceanquestdivecharters.com/charters/marker-buoy-8-4/."
