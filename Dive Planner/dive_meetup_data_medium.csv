It will be a fun day of diving complemented by delicious food! Our intended dive sites are KVI Tower and Maury Island Barges. KVI Tower's most popular site consists of a series of cement columns and rocks that make up the primary reef directly in from of the orange tower. They are covered with plumose anemones and swarmed with rock fish, perch, sculpin, greenling, etc. The structure is beautiful and reaches from approximately 30ft to 110ft with some boulders scattered up as far as 15ft on a low tide. About 50 yards away to the South is another finger of boulders that extends from about 60ft to 120ft. The reef extends on a steep sloping bottom that gets deep rapidly. The shallows are covered in eel grass and sea lettuce and house all sorts of small creatures such as gunnels and sole and make a great spot for safety stops. Visibility tends to be good and current is usually mild. Maury Island Barges has chunks of the original barges still intact creating hiding places for perch, lingcod and rockfish. You will usually see quite a few kelp greenling and ratfish here as well. We have also seen dogfish and the occasional sea lion! The barges intersect so you can easily swim from the remains of one barge to the others. Max depth is about 80' at the stern of the deepest barge. You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB). To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes (or somewhere close to it) from your tank. To sign up - sign up on Meetup, then go immediately to the Sea Ya Diving website www.seayadivingWA.com to pay for and reserve your spot ($85)."

This boat, which previously operated in the Hood Canal, is now ably run from North Tacom by Jamie and Karen Spink. And what a fun day of diving you will have! Accompanied by delicious food options both before and after your dives....fresh fruit, hot soup/stew and other goodies including hot beverages. As noted in ""The Perfect Dive"" website, Point Defiance North Wall is an advanced dive, near Owen Beach at Point Defiance in Tacoma. It boasts tall clay walls, dropping from 30’ at the top to 60-80’ at the base and is relatively sheltered from incoming tides (in other words it is divable during a low to moderate floods). The face of the wall is riddled with clam holes that have marred the face so that very little of the current swept wall is smooth. These holes make great homes for small creatures like nudibranchs, scallops and sculpin, while sea stars cling to the surface in search of their next meal. Rockfish and schools of perch swim in and out of the crevices. Sunrise Beach Reef is also an advanced dive due to potential currents. The main attraction of this site are the wolf eels tucked neatly in many of the holes found in the wall structure. There are many other species of sea life here as well including giant octopus. The wall is a series of large rock structures full of crevices, caves and boulders. It is a very beautiful, 3 dimensional dive…that is if you can look away from the wolf eels long enough to enjoy it! To get on this charter, first sign up on Meetup, then IMMEDIATELY go to the Sea Ya Diving website www.seaydivingWA.com to pay for your spots ($85). You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB).

Poke around the structures and look for critters in the crevices, or look up at the schooling rockfish. There is always something to see in these sites. Alki Fishing Reef is an artificial series of rock reefs created to encourage the attraction of fish and other marine life. There are 14 piles of concrete and rock debris that provide great structure for marine habitat set in patterns parallel to shore with depths between 40′ to 80′. Blake Island Reef is composed of concrete slabs, boxes, and other debris to encourage the attraction of marine life. These were barged in and deposited on a sandy/silt sea floor ranging in depths of 40′ to 100′ plus. The structures generally run parallel to the shore of Blake Island and are spread over a considerable distance. You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB). To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes (or somewhere close to it) from your tank. Ocean Quest provides coffee, tea, water as well as sandwiches and hot soup for lunch and delicious post-final-dive cookies! Bring all your gear, including two full tanks. As soon as you sign up on Meetup go immediately to the Ocean Quest website to pay ($90) to reserve your spot. Payment to Ocean Quest is the only way to confirm your place on the boat.

Features Wall, Boulder Pile / Shelves, Kelp Forest Description From the entry point, swim southwest toward the point of a relatively barren sandy bottom which turns to eel grass as you approach the point. Drop down when you reach the beginning of the point (just past the house with the bulkhead and where the steep cliff is on the shore) and follow the contour down and west as the slope becomes more prominent and turns into a series of ledges and then develops into a cascading wall covered in life. During summer months there will be kelp marking the wall so you can descend when you reach the barrier of kelp. The wall cascades down to about 85’ and is comprised of a series of steep shelves, overhangs and large rocks. Life covers nearly every surface of the wall and ledges LOTS of cucumbers and Giant Barnacles cover everything, huge urchins, sponges, GPOs, Puget Sound King Crab, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod, all sorts of perch and rockfish, etc. As you continue west it will become less gradual and you round the point. Come up over 40’ and ride the current back. The shallow section is just as interesting and dynamic as the deeper portions of the wall. Below the bottom of the wall the rock structure gives way to a steep sandy bottom. Special Restrictions: Beware of heavy currents. ONLY dive this site on slack before an ebb current (slack at high tide) or you will be fighting current both directions. Hop into the water about 30 minutes before slack and drift along the wall staying below 45’ on your way out. When you hit the end of the wall (it will start to turn into a slope and not so rocky) or when you are ready to turnaround, head up above 40’ and the current will bring you back toward the entry point. How to get there: From I-5 take exit 230 onto Highway 20 West toward Anacortes. Go all the way through Anacortes toward the Washington State Ferry Terminal. Hwy 20 will turn into Commercial Ave, then 12th, then Oaks just before the terminal. Take a left on Sunset Ave, then left onto Skyline Way, then right onto Cabana Way. Park at the end of the street past the marina on the beach side of the road. There is beach access just before the gate at the end of the road that leads to a house that sits on the water."

This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction. POINT DEFIANCE NORTH WALL: This gentle sloping wall consists of sandstone and rock structures beginning at 20′ and generally running down to 70-100′ but most divers choose to stay 70′ or more shallow. Clams that bore horizontal into the wall have made thousands of holes that have become homes for a great deal of marine life.

This is the only way to guarantee you are on the charter. We plan to dive Z's Reef first, which is about a 2 hour boat ride depending on weather and currents. It is a natural reef that runs parallel to shore beginning at around 45′ with a sloping bottom near 60′. This one is a great dive for wolf eel and octopus. It has some very interesting cut backs in the wall which provides numerous dens for these critters and HUGE lingcod. Z’s is also a great dive for nudibranchs! Although we dive it on the slack, as always with the Sound, some current can exist but this reef is long enough to just go with the flow and you can still see the wildlife. It is a live boat pick up Second dive is planned for Maury Island Gravel Mine. When this mine was in operation a very long time ago, several of the wooden barges used to carry gravel to construct SeaTac Airport sank while still tied to the row of pilings just off shore in approximately 40-70′. Since then the barges have deteriorated and are not providing the structure they once did, however they still offer home to a great deal of marine life – especially for the dive photographer that likes to shoot smaller creatures. North of the barges is a second dive site where the conveyor belt loader was situated to load off a concrete structure. As a result of some of the gravel boulders being dropped while loading, there is a large pile of them beginning in approximately 40′ and spreading out down to around 90, larger marine life and fish are located here. Bring all your own gear, including full scuba tanks! :-) Hot drinks, water and a soup/sandwich lunch and snacks are provided. Recent, local dive experience is valuable and, although the boat follows our bubbles to do live pick up, it's helpful to be comfortable with using an SMB and do a mid-water ascent."

May 19, 2018 - June 2, 2018 – (Ron Wilkinson) – ready to book, but needs a roommate Carl Baird and Bruce Brown have booked an 11-day trip to Cuba that includes 2 full days of touring Havana, then diving the Gardens of the Queen. For those who wish to dive with Carl and Bruce and forego the 2-days of touring Havana, you could just sign up for the May 26 – June 2 dive trip. Ron Wilkinson is ready to book his two week adventure to dive the Gardens of the Queen for two, back-to-back trips (May 19-May 26 and May 26-June 2). Ron has not yet booked his 2-week dive package on the La Reina because he first needs a roommate to qualify for the double occupancy rate. If you are interested in either of Ron’s May 19-May 26, or the May 26 – June 2, or both, please contact Ron (206-602-4460). Carl and Bruce plan is to fly to Havana on Tuesday, May 22 2018, spend 3 nights in a Havana hotel with 2 days of touring the Havana sites (see attached itinerary) then take a May 26 transfer bus to the Gardens of the Queen. Carl and Bruce will be on the La Reina live aboard from Saturday (May 26) until Saturday (June 2). Diving will be Sunday – Friday. We fly home from Camaguey, Cuba on June 2. The La Reina is a comfortable sixty-nine foot yacht, fully refurbished, with central air conditioning system, 4 double rooms, private bathrooms and hot water. It would be nice to fill all 8 seats with Marker Buoy Club members. If we fill the boat with 8 divers, we would receive one comp spot which would be split among everyone and reduce the price by about $348. A normal week includes 17 dives from Sunday to Friday; return to the mainland is on Saturday. It is possible to book extra dives on request. The cost of 2 days touring Havana and the La Reina live aboard is $4,575 (double occupancy). The base price for just the La Reina live aboard is $2,785 (double occupancy). You will also need a hotel room in Havana for your first night before the bus transfer. All of our arrangements (except airfare) have been through Luisa Sacerdote at Avalon Cuban Diving Centers. If you are just booking just the live aboard, then there may be some other fees (about $200) that Luisa can explain. Please reference Carl Baird’s group to Luisa to qualify all of us for any group price reductions, regardless of the trip package that you choose. A few weeks ago, Bruce and I each paid $478.16 for our airfare.

One consists of mainly large boulders beginning at around 30′ depth and ending at about 80′ depending on the tide. The other is comprised mostly of concrete pilings that are hay stacked so as to give some height off the sea bottom.

Please note that this charter is for advanced divers divers with experience in local current, good buoyancy control, be able to ascend without reference, and able to use a DSMB. To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes - or close to it - from a tank. Dalco Wall: This is a true wall dive. Most often the boat anchors in approximately 30′ of water and directs the divers out to approximately 40-60′ depth where the wall begins. This is where the sea floor is like walking to the edge of the Space Needle and provides a vertical drop down to 130-160′ before the sea floor becomes visible again. Current swept most of the time, this wall provides a great deal of food for small clinging marine life as well as cut back holes for wolf eel and octopus. The wall itself is often covered with shrimp so thick at times you cannot see the wall itself. Sunrise Beach Reef: The premier of natural underwater reef structures. This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction. There are two mooring buoys installed by the Washington Scuba Alliance which makes this an convenient site to boat dive. Currents at times can be unpredictable, so always be prepared to expect some current and hope that it will be slack at dive time! Live boat pick up makes an easy exit at this site. After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat.

The boat anchors in approximately 35′ depth and directs the divers to the 60′ zone where the walls begin. There are really two different walls here; the South is deeper than the North and runs further in distance, and more of a true “wall”. The North end is more of a series of ledges and cutbacks providing numerous dens and hidie holes for critters. Both provide a nice semi-steep structure filled with friendly wolf eel and octopus as they have been raised their entire lives around divers and often swim right up to your face. While we plan to dive on the slack, as your bottom time expires, some current often does come up and you may experience a drift dive. Point Defiance West Wall This site boasts tall clay walls, dropping from 30’ at the top to 60-80’ at the base and is relatively sheltered from incoming tides (in other words it is divable during a low to moderate floods). The face of the wall is riddled with clam holes that have marred the face so that very little of the current swept wall is smooth. These holes make great homes for small creatures like nudibranchs, scallops and sculpin, while sea stars cling to the surface in search of their next meal. Rockfish and schools of perch swim in and out of the crevices. After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat. We can take up to 8 people."

"Sun, Jan 14, 2018, 8:30 AM",South Sound Current Dive,Needs a location,10 comments,"Steve had to cancel and Sat was a bit early for me anyway. So, let's move to the dive to Sunday. 2.1 ebb > 10:24 AM slack > 2.1 flood (South Narrows). Low exchange. Meet: 8:30 AM, Splash 9:30 AM 2 options, depending on who signs up. Joyce and I are doing the easier north end. 1. Pretty Easy: North entrance, north and back. For Day Island on this exchange, this should be a a reasonably easy current entry level dive for anyone comfortable with their buoyancy and dive kit looking for the next step up. This is not a guarantee...but a pretty good probability. Swim is far shorter, exposure is much less, depths are shallower. Bailing is much easier. The group can do both. If some newer divers show up, I'll lead dive #2. People who know the site can still hit the more advance dive. This is a great scooter option. Visibility has been lackluster with all the rain lately but generally is not horrible on Day Island. 2. Seriously advanced: South entrance to North entrance drift. Possible variation: South entrance back to South entrance. For this option: Meet: 8:30 AM, Splash 9:10-9:15 AM Both variations are advanced dives with LONG swims IN CURRENT and plenty of exposure. Low viz won't be your friend. You NEED to be able to deal with a compass. If you don't have a fair amount of current experience, don't even consider this. Seriously. Limited Parking, no facilities, carpooling encouraged. Residential neighborhood and we want to keep our impact low and our presence minimal. Go out for late breakfast after.

Carpets of Plumose and other invertebrates cover the rocks which are teaming with Rockfish and Lingcod. This site is absolutelly beautiful. Breath taking actually. The jetty is exposed for about 1/2 of its lengh. The end of the exposed portion is about 30ft deep and continues in the same direction underwater to about 60ft. Special Restrictions: Make sure you time this at slack, it could be very dangerous if not timed right. Stay to the outside of the jetty and do not venture iside where the ferry passes. How to get there: The Jetty is located right next to the Port Townsend/Keystone ferry dock on Whidby Island. Parking is fairly limited.

After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat. We can take up to 8 people. Please note that both sites require divers to have experience in current, good buoyancy control, be able to ascend without reference, and able to use a DSMB. You must have experience in drift/current diving in the Pacific North West (Caribbean drift diving doesn't equate). Also, to ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes from a tank. Sunrise Reef: The premier of natural underwater reef structures. This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction. There are two mooring buoys installed by the Washington Scuba Alliance which makes this an convenient site to boat dive. Currents at times can be unpredictable, so always be prepared to expect some current and hope that it will be slack at dive time! Tacoma Narrows Depending on the direction of the current we will place divers on the East side of the Narrows either North of or South of the two bridges. Easy live boat drop near shore where you can descend against the shore rock walls. We recommend divers keep their depth to 70′ or less so as to avoid the potential for a water-down-fall in areas deeper than 70′. Lots of large fish and boulders littering the sea floor. The Narrows is a heavy boat traffic area so we strongly recommend each diver carry a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB) in case you are not able to ascend near shore (which is preferable). Divers must be aware of their depths and bottom times and we require you to be experienced in current diving. Questions? Let me know!"

With the complexity of the bottom and the poor viz, especially in the shallower areas, running into line is a real possibility. Parking can be an issue, more in the summer.

Skill Lv: Strong/Skilled Advanced Meet for dinner in town after the dive. ***Note, this dive is cross-posted with Moss Bay. Photographers love this dive! Features Wall, Boulder Pile / Shelves, Kelp Forest Description From the entry point, swim southwest toward the point of a relatively barren sandy bottom which turns to eel grass as you approach the point. Drop down when you reach the beginning of the point (just past the house with the bulkhead and where the steep cliff is on the shore) and follow the contour down and west as the slope becomes more prominent and turns into a series of ledges and then develops into a cascading wall covered in life. During summer months there will be kelp marking the wall so you can descend when you reach the barrier of kelp. The wall cascades down to about 85’ and is comprised of a series of steep shelves, overhangs and large rocks. Life covers nearly every surface of the wall and ledges LOTS of cucumbers and Giant Barnacles cover everything, huge urchins, sponges, GPOs, Puget Sound King Crab, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod, all sorts of perch and rockfish, etc. As you continue west it will become less gradual and you round the point. Come up over 40’ and ride the current back. The shallow section is just as interesting and dynamic as the deeper portions of the wall. Below the bottom of the wall the rock structure gives way to a steep sandy bottom. Special Restrictions: Beware of heavy currents. ONLY dive this site on slack before an ebb current (slack at high tide) or you will be fighting current both directions. Hop into the water about 30 minutes before slack and drift along the wall staying below 45’ on your way out. When you hit the end of the wall (it will start to turn into a slope and not so rocky) or when you are ready to turnaround, head up above 40’ and the current will bring you back toward the entry point. How to get there: From I-5 take exit 230 onto Highway 20 West toward Anacortes. Go all the way through Anacortes toward the Washington State Ferry Terminal. Hwy 20 will turn into Commercial Ave, then 12th, then Oaks just before the terminal. Take a left on Sunset Ave, then left onto Skyline Way, then right onto Cabana Way. Park at the end of the street past the marina on the beach side of the road. There is beach access just before the gate at the end of the road that leads to a house that sits on the water."

We'll do a quick site briefing once we're all accounted for and then assign buddies. Buddy pairs can make their own dive plan based on their objective. I'll have a map for us to use to help with planning. Underwater Sports is nearby if you need air or forget something. I'm planning on a 1 tank dive but those who wish to stay for 2 shouldn't have a problem - currents should be minimal. It's going to be warm - mid 70's and sunny when we're getting ready. Please plan accordingly and stay hydrated. Look for signs of heat stress. There's a cold water shower there if you need to chill while you're waiting for your buddy to finish getting ready. Parking is usually a challenge and will likely be more of a challenge this weekend. If there's no parking, the usual course of action is to wait in the turn-around until a spot opens. If nothing opens up or there's already a que, there's additional parking south of main street and east of railroad avenue. You can drop off your gear at the round-about and we'll watch over it.

After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat. We can take up to 8 people. Please note that both sites require divers to have experience in current, good buoyancy control, be able to ascend without reference, and able to use a DSMB. To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes from a tank. Four Mile Rock Barges are two 200 + foot long intact barges sitting aside of each other in approximately 90′ of water. These look more like ships than they typical square barge shape and offer a good introduction to wreck diving. They have been down for some time and have a great deal of marine life growing on them. Expect to see octopus, wolf eels, lingcod, warbonnets, and various macro life making homes in the barges. Blake Island Reef consists of man made structures (concrete slabs, boxes, and other debris) which encourage the attraction of marine life. These were barged in and deposited on a sandy/silt sea floor ranging in depths of 40′ to 100′ plus. The structures generally run parallel to the shore of Blake Island and are spread over a considerable distance which can accommodate multiple divers and boats. Questions? Let me know!"

This is a smaller exchange and suitable for divers ready for the next BIG step to high current for much of the dive. Experienced, advanced current divers only! NOT FOR LEARNING CURRENT DIVING. Once you start this dive you are absolutely committed. Don't even think about it unless you are very confident of your diving skills and current experience. If you have questions contact me. I don't like surprises on this dive. DP is a unique and spectacular dive, but it has the potential for high currents, whirlpools, severe up and down eddies, overhead boat traffic, fishing line, and seldom has even decent viz. Buddy separation can be an ever present issue and happens easily here. It is difficult re-connect once separated, which can happen rapidly, and is not uncommon. For your risk and effort you get an invertebrate dive that is unlike any other in Puget Sound. It is colorful and spectacular. 150-200 yard walk to the water with a medium hill. Good parking, restroom on site. Discover Pass required. Randy 206-387-6749 cell"

A good day to dive all day here at Saltwater. This is more of a big critter site consisting of three rock reefs. There is a very long swim out to the site itself (about 300m each way) and you should be comfortable going down to 70-80 feet as the reefs don't really start till around 50 feet. Chances of seeing wolf eel, octopus, tons of rockfish - including Vermillions - and the largest lingcod this side of Edmonds. A discovery pass is required, cost 35$/year avaliable on site via automated kiosk or at the discover pass site ( http://www.discoverpass.wa.gov/ ) If you plan to dive the 2nd tank with us please be aware that the estimate for the 2nd splash is very rough as swimming speeds getting to/from the site vary considerably."

I will also do an earlier non-hosted dive. You can join me, but bring a buddy. Meetup 10:15am, splash at 11am. Highly recommend carpooling. You can meet at the Safeway parking lot at SW 148th St and 1st Ave South. If not and if the parking lot is full at the dive site, then park on Maplewild Ave and hump your gear in.

Meetup 1:30PM, Splash 2:45pm. 2nd Skyline of the season. Hopefully warming up, critters out, and viz up. We'll see. Advanced dive with a long 200 yard swim. Potential poor visibility while in current possible (hopefully not) puts some challenge in keep buddy pairs intact. When it's good it's one of the best invert shore dives in the Sound, lots of color and great things to see. Possibilities for candy stripe shrimp, PS King Crab, juv. wolf eels, and GPO. Divers should have a cutting tool and be aware of fishing line. The path along the shore is used by fisherman. With the complexity of the bottom and the poor viz, especially in the shallower areas, running into line is a real possibility. Parking can be a big issue, less so in the winter months. I strongly suggest carpooling, which helps with the longer drive also. No facilities on site -stop in Anacortes or nearby Washington Park before coming over. Debriefing in Anacortes after the dive; Brown Lantern, Rockfish, or the Bowling Alley depending on how busy things are. Fritz 206-525-0736 home 206-370-4720 cell"

Note: this is a wall dive, the wall goes all the way down to 190 ft, so you should have good buoyancy control, you should have experience with wall dives. Also, remember that for fresh water you must reduce your weight by 5-6 lbs. Visibility may be poor, so close cooperation with your dive buddy is a must, good dive torch is necessary and tank a tank flashing light is strongly recommended. Let's meet at 10 a.m., splash at ~10:40. We can potentially do two tanks if you're interested. Access: Shore dive from the beach. Parking: Park on the north side of the park. Amenities: Bathrooms Attractions: Great Rock Formations, and good crawdad hunting. Details: Swim out past the south swim platform and drop 20', then head due west down the slope to 30' where you will hit the top of the wall. Wall drops straight to 190'.

Dive in hopefully mild current. This is the north entrance going north profile, the easiest day island profile on what looks to be a very mild current exchange. Con - you'll have to be a real early riser...or still up from the night before. Recommended to have some experience in current, preferably at day island. If you haven't done day island before please message me before (or at least when) signing up. Note: You may be noticing the splash time seems slightly off. This is because the current table for South Narrows Midstream changed recently, it seems to be showing slack occurring 12 minutes earlier than the 'old' tables with the known correction factors - and dives using the old tables/factors still work fine. Hence the slightly different correction."

I hear that Three Tree Point will be open at this time. However, it may be a hike as I'm not sure what the parking situation looks like and we may have to park on the road. Three Tree is a fairly current insensitive dive, so there's a good possibility of a second tank - before or after. I, however, will only be doing a single dive. I'm going to limit this to 8 divers, due to the parking situation. Carpooling is highly encouraged. I'm going to run by this site ahead of time. I may remove the limit depending on what I find. On the other hand, I may have to remove or relocate this dive if it's still not open."
