It will be a fun day of diving complemented by delicious food! Our intended dive sites are KVI Tower and Maury Island Barges. KVI Tower's most popular site consists of a series of cement columns and rocks that make up the primary reef directly in from of the orange tower. They are covered with plumose anemones and swarmed with rock fish, perch, sculpin, greenling, etc. The structure is beautiful and reaches from approximately 30ft to 110ft with some boulders scattered up as far as 15ft on a low tide. About 50 yards away to the South is another finger of boulders that extends from about 60ft to 120ft. The reef extends on a steep sloping bottom that gets deep rapidly. The shallows are covered in eel grass and sea lettuce and house all sorts of small creatures such as gunnels and sole and make a great spot for safety stops. Visibility tends to be good and current is usually mild. Maury Island Barges has chunks of the original barges still intact creating hiding places for perch, lingcod and rockfish. You will usually see quite a few kelp greenling and ratfish here as well. We have also seen dogfish and the occasional sea lion! The barges intersect so you can easily swim from the remains of one barge to the others. Max depth is about 80' at the stern of the deepest barge. You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB). To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes (or somewhere close to it) from your tank. To sign up - sign up on Meetup, then go immediately to the Sea Ya Diving website www.seayadivingWA.com to pay for and reserve your spot ($85)."

This boat, which previously operated in the Hood Canal, is now ably run from North Tacom by Jamie and Karen Spink. And what a fun day of diving you will have! Accompanied by delicious food options both before and after your dives....fresh fruit, hot soup/stew and other goodies including hot beverages. As noted in ""The Perfect Dive"" website, Point Defiance North Wall is an advanced dive, near Owen Beach at Point Defiance in Tacoma. It boasts tall clay walls, dropping from 30’ at the top to 60-80’ at the base and is relatively sheltered from incoming tides (in other words it is divable during a low to moderate floods). The face of the wall is riddled with clam holes that have marred the face so that very little of the current swept wall is smooth. These holes make great homes for small creatures like nudibranchs, scallops and sculpin, while sea stars cling to the surface in search of their next meal. Rockfish and schools of perch swim in and out of the crevices. Sunrise Beach Reef is also an advanced dive due to potential currents. The main attraction of this site are the wolf eels tucked neatly in many of the holes found in the wall structure. There are many other species of sea life here as well including giant octopus. The wall is a series of large rock structures full of crevices, caves and boulders. It is a very beautiful, 3 dimensional dive…that is if you can look away from the wolf eels long enough to enjoy it! To get on this charter, first sign up on Meetup, then IMMEDIATELY go to the Sea Ya Diving website www.seaydivingWA.com to pay for your spots ($85). You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB).

Poke around the structures and look for critters in the crevices, or look up at the schooling rockfish. There is always something to see in these sites. Alki Fishing Reef is an artificial series of rock reefs created to encourage the attraction of fish and other marine life. There are 14 piles of concrete and rock debris that provide great structure for marine habitat set in patterns parallel to shore with depths between 40′ to 80′. Blake Island Reef is composed of concrete slabs, boxes, and other debris to encourage the attraction of marine life. These were barged in and deposited on a sandy/silt sea floor ranging in depths of 40′ to 100′ plus. The structures generally run parallel to the shore of Blake Island and are spread over a considerable distance. You should have at least an advanced certification with experience diving in currents, depths deeper than 60′, good buoyancy skills and experience in mid water ascents using a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB). To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes (or somewhere close to it) from your tank. Ocean Quest provides coffee, tea, water as well as sandwiches and hot soup for lunch and delicious post-final-dive cookies! Bring all your gear, including two full tanks. As soon as you sign up on Meetup go immediately to the Ocean Quest website to pay ($90) to reserve your spot. Payment to Ocean Quest is the only way to confirm your place on the boat.

Features Wall, Boulder Pile / Shelves, Kelp Forest Description From the entry point, swim southwest toward the point of a relatively barren sandy bottom which turns to eel grass as you approach the point. Drop down when you reach the beginning of the point (just past the house with the bulkhead and where the steep cliff is on the shore) and follow the contour down and west as the slope becomes more prominent and turns into a series of ledges and then develops into a cascading wall covered in life. During summer months there will be kelp marking the wall so you can descend when you reach the barrier of kelp. The wall cascades down to about 85’ and is comprised of a series of steep shelves, overhangs and large rocks. Life covers nearly every surface of the wall and ledges LOTS of cucumbers and Giant Barnacles cover everything, huge urchins, sponges, GPOs, Puget Sound King Crab, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod, all sorts of perch and rockfish, etc. As you continue west it will become less gradual and you round the point. Come up over 40’ and ride the current back. The shallow section is just as interesting and dynamic as the deeper portions of the wall. Below the bottom of the wall the rock structure gives way to a steep sandy bottom. Special Restrictions: Beware of heavy currents. ONLY dive this site on slack before an ebb current (slack at high tide) or you will be fighting current both directions. Hop into the water about 30 minutes before slack and drift along the wall staying below 45’ on your way out. When you hit the end of the wall (it will start to turn into a slope and not so rocky) or when you are ready to turnaround, head up above 40’ and the current will bring you back toward the entry point. How to get there: From I-5 take exit 230 onto Highway 20 West toward Anacortes. Go all the way through Anacortes toward the Washington State Ferry Terminal. Hwy 20 will turn into Commercial Ave, then 12th, then Oaks just before the terminal. Take a left on Sunset Ave, then left onto Skyline Way, then right onto Cabana Way. Park at the end of the street past the marina on the beach side of the road. There is beach access just before the gate at the end of the road that leads to a house that sits on the water."

This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction. POINT DEFIANCE NORTH WALL: This gentle sloping wall consists of sandstone and rock structures beginning at 20′ and generally running down to 70-100′ but most divers choose to stay 70′ or more shallow. Clams that bore horizontal into the wall have made thousands of holes that have become homes for a great deal of marine life.

This is the only way to guarantee you are on the charter. We plan to dive Z's Reef first, which is about a 2 hour boat ride depending on weather and currents. It is a natural reef that runs parallel to shore beginning at around 45′ with a sloping bottom near 60′. This one is a great dive for wolf eel and octopus. It has some very interesting cut backs in the wall which provides numerous dens for these critters and HUGE lingcod. Z’s is also a great dive for nudibranchs! Although we dive it on the slack, as always with the Sound, some current can exist but this reef is long enough to just go with the flow and you can still see the wildlife. It is a live boat pick up Second dive is planned for Maury Island Gravel Mine. When this mine was in operation a very long time ago, several of the wooden barges used to carry gravel to construct SeaTac Airport sank while still tied to the row of pilings just off shore in approximately 40-70′. Since then the barges have deteriorated and are not providing the structure they once did, however they still offer home to a great deal of marine life – especially for the dive photographer that likes to shoot smaller creatures. North of the barges is a second dive site where the conveyor belt loader was situated to load off a concrete structure. As a result of some of the gravel boulders being dropped while loading, there is a large pile of them beginning in approximately 40′ and spreading out down to around 90, larger marine life and fish are located here. Bring all your own gear, including full scuba tanks! :-) Hot drinks, water and a soup/sandwich lunch and snacks are provided. Recent, local dive experience is valuable and, although the boat follows our bubbles to do live pick up, it's helpful to be comfortable with using an SMB and do a mid-water ascent."

You will also find a 15 stair steps and then 125 paces down a straight hill to the cobblestone beach.

May 19, 2018 - June 2, 2018 – (Ron Wilkinson) – ready to book, but needs a roommate Carl Baird and Bruce Brown have booked an 11-day trip to Cuba that includes 2 full days of touring Havana, then diving the Gardens of the Queen. For those who wish to dive with Carl and Bruce and forego the 2-days of touring Havana, you could just sign up for the May 26 – June 2 dive trip. Ron Wilkinson is ready to book his two week adventure to dive the Gardens of the Queen for two, back-to-back trips (May 19-May 26 and May 26-June 2). Ron has not yet booked his 2-week dive package on the La Reina because he first needs a roommate to qualify for the double occupancy rate. If you are interested in either of Ron’s May 19-May 26, or the May 26 – June 2, or both, please contact Ron (206-602-4460). Carl and Bruce plan is to fly to Havana on Tuesday, May 22 2018, spend 3 nights in a Havana hotel with 2 days of touring the Havana sites (see attached itinerary) then take a May 26 transfer bus to the Gardens of the Queen. Carl and Bruce will be on the La Reina live aboard from Saturday (May 26) until Saturday (June 2). Diving will be Sunday – Friday. We fly home from Camaguey, Cuba on June 2. The La Reina is a comfortable sixty-nine foot yacht, fully refurbished, with central air conditioning system, 4 double rooms, private bathrooms and hot water. It would be nice to fill all 8 seats with Marker Buoy Club members. If we fill the boat with 8 divers, we would receive one comp spot which would be split among everyone and reduce the price by about $348. A normal week includes 17 dives from Sunday to Friday; return to the mainland is on Saturday. It is possible to book extra dives on request. The cost of 2 days touring Havana and the La Reina live aboard is $4,575 (double occupancy). The base price for just the La Reina live aboard is $2,785 (double occupancy). You will also need a hotel room in Havana for your first night before the bus transfer. All of our arrangements (except airfare) have been through Luisa Sacerdote at Avalon Cuban Diving Centers. If you are just booking just the live aboard, then there may be some other fees (about $200) that Luisa can explain. Please reference Carl Baird’s group to Luisa to qualify all of us for any group price reductions, regardless of the trip package that you choose. A few weeks ago, Bruce and I each paid $478.16 for our airfare.

One consists of mainly large boulders beginning at around 30′ depth and ending at about 80′ depending on the tide. The other is comprised mostly of concrete pilings that are hay stacked so as to give some height off the sea bottom.

Please note that this charter is for advanced divers divers with experience in local current, good buoyancy control, be able to ascend without reference, and able to use a DSMB. To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes - or close to it - from a tank. Dalco Wall: This is a true wall dive. Most often the boat anchors in approximately 30′ of water and directs the divers out to approximately 40-60′ depth where the wall begins. This is where the sea floor is like walking to the edge of the Space Needle and provides a vertical drop down to 130-160′ before the sea floor becomes visible again. Current swept most of the time, this wall provides a great deal of food for small clinging marine life as well as cut back holes for wolf eel and octopus. The wall itself is often covered with shrimp so thick at times you cannot see the wall itself. Sunrise Beach Reef: The premier of natural underwater reef structures. This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction. There are two mooring buoys installed by the Washington Scuba Alliance which makes this an convenient site to boat dive. Currents at times can be unpredictable, so always be prepared to expect some current and hope that it will be slack at dive time! Live boat pick up makes an easy exit at this site. After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat.

The boat anchors in approximately 35′ depth and directs the divers to the 60′ zone where the walls begin. There are really two different walls here; the South is deeper than the North and runs further in distance, and more of a true “wall”. The North end is more of a series of ledges and cutbacks providing numerous dens and hidie holes for critters. Both provide a nice semi-steep structure filled with friendly wolf eel and octopus as they have been raised their entire lives around divers and often swim right up to your face. While we plan to dive on the slack, as your bottom time expires, some current often does come up and you may experience a drift dive. Point Defiance West Wall This site boasts tall clay walls, dropping from 30’ at the top to 60-80’ at the base and is relatively sheltered from incoming tides (in other words it is divable during a low to moderate floods). The face of the wall is riddled with clam holes that have marred the face so that very little of the current swept wall is smooth. These holes make great homes for small creatures like nudibranchs, scallops and sculpin, while sea stars cling to the surface in search of their next meal. Rockfish and schools of perch swim in and out of the crevices. After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat. We can take up to 8 people."

"Sun, Jan 14, 2018, 8:30 AM",South Sound Current Dive,Needs a location,10 comments,"Steve had to cancel and Sat was a bit early for me anyway. So, let's move to the dive to Sunday. 2.1 ebb > 10:24 AM slack > 2.1 flood (South Narrows). Low exchange. Meet: 8:30 AM, Splash 9:30 AM 2 options, depending on who signs up. Joyce and I are doing the easier north end. 1. Pretty Easy: North entrance, north and back. For Day Island on this exchange, this should be a a reasonably easy current entry level dive for anyone comfortable with their buoyancy and dive kit looking for the next step up. This is not a guarantee...but a pretty good probability. Swim is far shorter, exposure is much less, depths are shallower. Bailing is much easier. The group can do both. If some newer divers show up, I'll lead dive #2. People who know the site can still hit the more advance dive. This is a great scooter option. Visibility has been lackluster with all the rain lately but generally is not horrible on Day Island. 2. Seriously advanced: South entrance to North entrance drift. Possible variation: South entrance back to South entrance. For this option: Meet: 8:30 AM, Splash 9:10-9:15 AM Both variations are advanced dives with LONG swims IN CURRENT and plenty of exposure. Low viz won't be your friend. You NEED to be able to deal with a compass. If you don't have a fair amount of current experience, don't even consider this. Seriously. Limited Parking, no facilities, carpooling encouraged. Residential neighborhood and we want to keep our impact low and our presence minimal. Go out for late breakfast after.

Carpets of Plumose and other invertebrates cover the rocks which are teaming with Rockfish and Lingcod. This site is absolutelly beautiful. Breath taking actually. The jetty is exposed for about 1/2 of its lengh. The end of the exposed portion is about 30ft deep and continues in the same direction underwater to about 60ft. Special Restrictions: Make sure you time this at slack, it could be very dangerous if not timed right. Stay to the outside of the jetty and do not venture iside where the ferry passes. How to get there: The Jetty is located right next to the Port Townsend/Keystone ferry dock on Whidby Island. Parking is fairly limited.

After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat. We can take up to 8 people. Please note that both sites require divers to have experience in current, good buoyancy control, be able to ascend without reference, and able to use a DSMB. You must have experience in drift/current diving in the Pacific North West (Caribbean drift diving doesn't equate). Also, to ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes from a tank. Sunrise Reef: The premier of natural underwater reef structures. This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction. There are two mooring buoys installed by the Washington Scuba Alliance which makes this an convenient site to boat dive. Currents at times can be unpredictable, so always be prepared to expect some current and hope that it will be slack at dive time! Tacoma Narrows Depending on the direction of the current we will place divers on the East side of the Narrows either North of or South of the two bridges. Easy live boat drop near shore where you can descend against the shore rock walls. We recommend divers keep their depth to 70′ or less so as to avoid the potential for a water-down-fall in areas deeper than 70′. Lots of large fish and boulders littering the sea floor. The Narrows is a heavy boat traffic area so we strongly recommend each diver carry a Surface Marker Buoy (SMB) in case you are not able to ascend near shore (which is preferable). Divers must be aware of their depths and bottom times and we require you to be experienced in current diving. Questions? Let me know!"

With the complexity of the bottom and the poor viz, especially in the shallower areas, running into line is a real possibility. Parking can be an issue, more in the summer.

Skill Lv: Strong/Skilled Advanced Meet for dinner in town after the dive. ***Note, this dive is cross-posted with Moss Bay. Photographers love this dive! Features Wall, Boulder Pile / Shelves, Kelp Forest Description From the entry point, swim southwest toward the point of a relatively barren sandy bottom which turns to eel grass as you approach the point. Drop down when you reach the beginning of the point (just past the house with the bulkhead and where the steep cliff is on the shore) and follow the contour down and west as the slope becomes more prominent and turns into a series of ledges and then develops into a cascading wall covered in life. During summer months there will be kelp marking the wall so you can descend when you reach the barrier of kelp. The wall cascades down to about 85’ and is comprised of a series of steep shelves, overhangs and large rocks. Life covers nearly every surface of the wall and ledges LOTS of cucumbers and Giant Barnacles cover everything, huge urchins, sponges, GPOs, Puget Sound King Crab, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod, all sorts of perch and rockfish, etc. As you continue west it will become less gradual and you round the point. Come up over 40’ and ride the current back. The shallow section is just as interesting and dynamic as the deeper portions of the wall. Below the bottom of the wall the rock structure gives way to a steep sandy bottom. Special Restrictions: Beware of heavy currents. ONLY dive this site on slack before an ebb current (slack at high tide) or you will be fighting current both directions. Hop into the water about 30 minutes before slack and drift along the wall staying below 45’ on your way out. When you hit the end of the wall (it will start to turn into a slope and not so rocky) or when you are ready to turnaround, head up above 40’ and the current will bring you back toward the entry point. How to get there: From I-5 take exit 230 onto Highway 20 West toward Anacortes. Go all the way through Anacortes toward the Washington State Ferry Terminal. Hwy 20 will turn into Commercial Ave, then 12th, then Oaks just before the terminal. Take a left on Sunset Ave, then left onto Skyline Way, then right onto Cabana Way. Park at the end of the street past the marina on the beach side of the road. There is beach access just before the gate at the end of the road that leads to a house that sits on the water."

We'll do a quick site briefing once we're all accounted for and then assign buddies. Buddy pairs can make their own dive plan based on their objective. I'll have a map for us to use to help with planning. Underwater Sports is nearby if you need air or forget something. I'm planning on a 1 tank dive but those who wish to stay for 2 shouldn't have a problem - currents should be minimal. It's going to be warm - mid 70's and sunny when we're getting ready. Please plan accordingly and stay hydrated. Look for signs of heat stress. There's a cold water shower there if you need to chill while you're waiting for your buddy to finish getting ready. Parking is usually a challenge and will likely be more of a challenge this weekend. If there's no parking, the usual course of action is to wait in the turn-around until a spot opens. If nothing opens up or there's already a que, there's additional parking south of main street and east of railroad avenue. You can drop off your gear at the round-about and we'll watch over it.

After you sign up on MeetUp, go to the Ocean Quest website to reserve and pay for your spot ($90 at oceanquestdivecharters.com) That is the ONLY way to guarantee your spot on the boat. We can take up to 8 people. Please note that both sites require divers to have experience in current, good buoyancy control, be able to ascend without reference, and able to use a DSMB. To ensure that everyone can ""get their money's worth"" from the dive, unless you are signing up with buddy who is okay with shorter dive times, you should be able to get 60 minutes from a tank. Four Mile Rock Barges are two 200 + foot long intact barges sitting aside of each other in approximately 90′ of water. These look more like ships than they typical square barge shape and offer a good introduction to wreck diving. They have been down for some time and have a great deal of marine life growing on them. Expect to see octopus, wolf eels, lingcod, warbonnets, and various macro life making homes in the barges. Blake Island Reef consists of man made structures (concrete slabs, boxes, and other debris) which encourage the attraction of marine life. These were barged in and deposited on a sandy/silt sea floor ranging in depths of 40′ to 100′ plus. The structures generally run parallel to the shore of Blake Island and are spread over a considerable distance which can accommodate multiple divers and boats. Questions? Let me know!"

This is a smaller exchange and suitable for divers ready for the next BIG step to high current for much of the dive. Experienced, advanced current divers only! NOT FOR LEARNING CURRENT DIVING. Once you start this dive you are absolutely committed. Don't even think about it unless you are very confident of your diving skills and current experience. If you have questions contact me. I don't like surprises on this dive. DP is a unique and spectacular dive, but it has the potential for high currents, whirlpools, severe up and down eddies, overhead boat traffic, fishing line, and seldom has even decent viz. Buddy separation can be an ever present issue and happens easily here. It is difficult re-connect once separated, which can happen rapidly, and is not uncommon. For your risk and effort you get an invertebrate dive that is unlike any other in Puget Sound. It is colorful and spectacular. 150-200 yard walk to the water with a medium hill.

When it's good it's one of the best invert shore dives in the Sound, lots of color and great things to see. Possibilities for candy stripe shrimp, PS King Crab, juv. wolf eels, and GPO. Divers should have a cutting tool and be aware of fishing line. The path along the shore is used by fisherman. With the complexity of the bottom and the poor viz, especially in the shallower areas, running into line is a real possibility. Parking can be a big issue, less so in the winter months. I strongly suggest carpooling, which helps with the longer drive also. No facilities on site -stop in Anacortes or nearby Washington Park before coming over.

Off the Dock: 7:30am 2 dives Skill Level: Advanced Divers, comfortable in current Required to Dive: Surface Marker & Dive Alert / Noise Maker Cost: $150 per person, ""Payment in advance is required"" Due upon sign-up. Checks payable to: NW Dive Charters Send Deposit Checks to: ""seat not confirmed until payment is received"" Randy Koch, Diamond Knot 11659 104th Ave NE Kirkland, WA 98034 The Diamond Knot has achieved the status of legend amongst divers in the Pacific Northwest, as one of the most difficult, yet rewarding dives in the cold waters off of Washington State. The massive 326 foot wreck lies off of tongue point in the current swept Straits of Juan de Fuca, where it sank in 1947 after colliding in the fog with the SS Fen Victory. When she went to the bottom, she carried 154,000 cases of Alaskan canned salmon with her. The cargo was then valued at over four million dollars and represented ten percent of the Alaska salmon catch that year! For divers, the nutrient rich currents can be tricky, but oh so rewarding when you time the tides and weather right and drop down the line to the Knot. Every square inch of her massive structure is covered with huge billowy white Metridium Anemones. Warbonnets and Wolf eels slither across the decks and companionways in search of their next meal. Huge schools of Black and Yellowtail rockfish duck out of the current behind bits of the wreckage, along with an occasional Canary or colorful China rockfish. The back section of the wreck is most often visited by divers and is the shallower section of the ship, which lies on its starboard side. The wheelhouse, lifeboat winches and much of the aft deck structure are still in place and are covered with colorful sponges and spectacular marine growth. The forward section of the shipwreck is rarely visited, but just as rewarding. Large wolf eels and octopus are found throughout the wreckage along with many colorful grunt sculpins and gunnels. The wreck was salvaged in 1947 for its cargo of canned salmon, using an innovative water vacuum to suck up the cans. Large holes were cut in the side of the ship to access the cargo holds, which eventually caused the middle section of the wreck to collapse. This makes navigating from the front section of the ship to the stern section a “leap of faith” across a rubble strewn field that is scattered about the bottom of the Straits of Juan de Fuca. The Diamond Knot isn’t really that deep. The port side of the hull on the aft section is only about 80’ deep, which the bottom only about 125’ deep. What makes the Diamond Knot so alluring for divers is the 60 years of growth, and the extremely challenging conditions that divers can face when diving this magnificent site. The surface conditions in the Straits are often very choppy on top of a large ocean swell coming in from the Pacific Ocean. Add to that a fickle, but strong current that frequently changes direction, and you’ll understand why the wreck is considered a very advanced dive. When you time the currents and weather just right, dropping down onto the deck of the Diamond Knot is a dream dive. There is so much color and life to see everywhere you look. The history of the salvage and the amazing hard hat divers that worked the ship pervades the ghost like appearance of the remaining structure. Leaving the ship at the end of your dive is hard to do and very sad. There is almost always some current on the wreck, and you’ll find yourself hiding out in the lee of a piece of wreckage, admiring a vase sponge or warbonnet. Suddenly, the current will swap directions and shoot you up over the hull and out into the emerald green waters of the straits. This can happen very fast and catches even the most experienced divers by surprise. I know several divers that made a free ascent in green water after being blown off of the wreck, and have then spent several hours drifting in the Straits of Juan de Fuca, waiting for the boat to pick then up. The boat often can’t see them drifting away due to the very rough surface conditions that frequent this site. Drifting in the straits all alone isn’t the best way to spend an afternoon, and even the large nine foot tall surface marker buoys can often be very hard to spot in the large swell and chop that seem to come up so quickly."

Quite a few of you, yeah but at NIGHT? Rhoda Green has made it possible (Permit) to do night dives at SW Park. On Feb 18th will be the first of possibly many more. Meetup is 4pm with a 5:00pm Splash. -3.0E to 1.4F at the North Narrows station. slack at 5:41pm. Sunset is 5:34pm. We may get lucky and get a slight push coming in during the flood This is an all divers dive who have night dive experience and good navigational skills. If your navigation is in need of a refresher, then I highly recommend you take Bob Bailey's workshop on Jan 29th or the second one if the first one is full. See club calendar for details. Very long swim out. Up to 175 - 200 yards surface swim. There are 3 rock piles running in a east/west direction and ranging from 55ft to 85ft deep. The southern most is normally called the 1st rock pile. You can use the yellow buoy as a guide to the pile, but drop about 50 yards short of it to find the beginning of the pile. The 2nd or middle rock pile (I believe it's the largest one) is approximately 60-70ft north of #1 pile and it is the same for #3 from #2 pile. For a more shallow dive checkout the remnants of the old barge skeletal remains and tire field north of it. The barge is in 40-50ft of water. At the north end of the barge you'll find a large tire with a one inch rope tied to it. This will take you on approximately a 350 degree heading through the tire field. To end your dive just back track. What will you find? Ling Cods, GPO's, a large variety of Rockfish including Vermilian's. Sanddab's, Nudibranch, Wolf Eels, Greenlings, Sculpins and maybe, just maybe a six gill shark and who knows what else since no one could dive the park at night. Bring your compass, working primary and secondary lights. I also recommend tank light. Don't forget your camera. The restroom will be open, but the showers are off. You will be required to have a park pass, which can be purchased from the machine at the guard house. Randy Williams will be providing colored navigational lights should you surface swim in."

Alki Fishing Reef is an artificial series of reefs created to attract fish and other marine life. The reef consists of numerous piles of concrete and rock debris that provide great structure for marine habitat. These reefs are set in patterns parallel to shore with depths between 40′ to 80′ depending on the height of the tide and the location of which reef the diver chooses to explore. Blake Island Reef also consists of man made structures (concrete slabs, boxes, and other debris) which encourage the attraction of marine life. These were barged in and deposited on a sandy/silt sea floor ranging in depths of 40′ to 100′ plus. The structures generally run parallel to the shore of Blake Island and are spread over a considerable distance which can accommodate multiple divers and boats. Questions? Let me know!

Highly recommend a tank light. Have your tank preassembled before you arrive. This will allow for a quick gearing up or just come earlier. I figure there will be less highway traffic and give those up north ample time to Redondo. Viz has been very good at all dive locations and I don't anticipate any change to that. Bob Bailey has been seeing Lumpsuckers on the southern side of the fishing pier and some of you photographers may want to take advantage of that.

Once you sign up on Meet Up, go to the Ocean Quest Dive Charter website reservation calendar to reserve and pay for your spot. We can go with as few as 5 divers and a max of 8 divers. The cost is $90 for two dives. Dive sites are Point Defiance Wall and Dalco Wall. From the Ocean Quest website - description of the sites and recommended diver skill levels are as follow: Point Defiance Wall: This gentle sloping wall consists of sandstone and rock structures beginning at 20′ and generally running down to 70-100′ but most divers choose to stay 70′ or more shallow. Clams that bore horizontal into the wall have made thousands of holes that have become homes for a great deal of marine life. Although this area has octopus and larger fish, most divers admire it for the structure it provides. All skill levels. Dalco Wall: This is a true wall dive. Most often we anchor in approximately 30′ of water and direct the divers out to approximately 40-60′ depth where the wall begins. This is where the sea floor is like walking to the edge of the Space Needle and provides a vertical drop down to 130-160′ before the sea floor becomes visible again. Current swept most of the time, this wall provides a great deal of food for small clinging marine life as well as cut back holes for wolf eel and octopus. The wall itself is often covered with shrimp so thick at times you cannot see the wall itself. *We encourage and strongly recommend that divers be advanced level or higher for this dive due to current and depth. We recommend that all divers carry Surface Marker Buoys (SMB) in case you need to make a mid water ascent."

We live in an area rich with tides and the resulting currents. Either you dive non-current intensive sites, throw yourself on the mercy and knowledge of others to figure them out, or you learn how to calculate when it's safe to dive sites impacted by current. A smart diver learns how to figure the currents. You are the one out there. What you will need: • Some kind of CURRENT reference/chart. This can be computer based (laptop), tablet, phone, or printed (I think you can still get these in marine stores). A tide only reference will not be helpful. Tides create the currents, but we need the current info to work with. Doug Miller has posted some good references (http://www.meetup.com/Marker-Buoy-Dive-Club/pages/6446802/Scuba-related_links/) in Meetup. • Some paper and writing utensil to calculate with. Strongly suggested: Northwest Shore Dives, 3rd Ed. Stephen Fischnaller.

If you are familiar with that chapter you will get a lot more out of this class. The book is no longer in print, but available from Amazon, possibly used book stores, or other agencies (2nd Ed. is OK if you can't get 3rd Ed.). NWSD lists dozens of shore dives in the NW along with critical current correction factors. The correction factors are key to knowing when is the appropriate TIME to dive a site. Local knowledge and experience are key to knowing HOW LARGE an exchange is to safely dive the site, along with unique features and characteristics of a dive site. This information is also in NWSD. Doug Coutts is loaning us his office in the University Heights Bldg. at 50th and University Way in the U. District. I think we'll have wifi (will confirm), and I'll be bringing the club projector.

Divers carve in teams (dive buddies, ya know...) and supply their own pumpkins and carving implements. Carving implements should be blunt tipped for safety. All additional items used to decorate the submitted carved pumpkin need to be taken from the marine environment.

Lots of rockfish, sculpins, nudibranchs, and swimming scallops. Great topography as well. This is a dive that's probably not ideal for beginners. Most of the time, currents cooperate.

When it's good it's one of the best invert shore dives in the Sound, lots of color and great things to see. Possibilities for candy stripe shrimp, PS King Crab, juv. wolf eels, and GPO. Divers they should have a cutting tool and be aware of fishing line. The path along the shore is used by fisherman. With the complexity of the bottom and the poor viz, especially in the shallower areas, running into line is a real possibility. Parking can be a big issue. I strongly suggest carpooling, which helps with the longer drive also. Historically the motorcycles a have not been an issue here. No facilities-stop in Anacortes or nearby Washington Park before coming over. Debriefing in is up in the air due to the generalize congestion in town. Maybe go back to Mt. Vernon Skagit Valley Pub.

Do to the permit and food any small donation would be appreciated. Plan for 2 dives Description The Possession Point Reef is made of multiple rocky ""fingers-like"" projections on the southern tip of Whidbey Island that cascade down from about 30 ft to well over 130 ft in a series of rugged walls and ledges with sheer drop-offs in places creating absolutely stunning terrain. There are many nooks and crevices to explore for octopus. Many nudibranchs and sponges can be found nestled on the silty walls, while schools of perch pass over rockfish, kelp greenling and lingcod. Special Restrictions: This site is subject to heavy current and a moderate amount of boat traffic. The fingers run very deep making a good site for tech divers. Please watch your bottom time and use a live boat. Many good local dive charters frequent this area. Visibility is affected by nearby river runoff (the snohomish). How to get there: The Possession Point Fingers is located on the southern tip of Whidbey Island. It can be found by the large cleared lawn area surrounding the southern-most building on the east side of Possession point. Multiple fingers extend just south of this location and should be easily recognizable from the water's edge."

This is an opportunity to experience some current without much a swim to return to shore. The wall is primarily layered sandstone south of the fishing pier at Fox Island Fishing Pier parking site.

Or maybe you are self-employed, retired or can be a slacker for a day! Let's enjoy the great Pacific Northwest early fall weather with a couple of great boat dives. Ocean Quest recommends, for these sites, at least advanced certification with experience in currents, good buoyancy control and experience in mid-water ascents with SMB. Sign up on Meet Up and then immediately go to Ocean Quest Dive Charters website to reserve and pay for your spot. ($90 for two dives). Dalco Wall: This is a true wall dive. Most often we anchor in approximately 30′ of water and direct the divers out to approximately 40-60′ depth where the wall begins. This is where the sea floor is like walking to the edge of the Space Needle and provides a vertical drop down to 130-160′ before the sea floor becomes visible again.Current swept most of the time, this wall provides a great deal of food for small clinging marine life as well as cut back holes for wolf eel and octopus. The wall itself is often covered with shrimp so thick at times you cannot see the wall itself. Sunrise Reef: The premier of natural underwater reef structures. This reef consists of clay, sandstone, and rock and runs parallel to shore (north/south) beginning at about 45′ and max’s out at around 55-60′. This is a marine protected site, so it contains lots of colorful life – especially wolf eel and octopus, which are the main attraction.There are two mooring buoys installed by the Washington Scuba Alliance which makes this an convenient site to boat dive. Currents at times can be unpredictable, so always be prepared to expect some current and hope that it will be slack at dive time! Live boat pick up makes an easy exit at this site. Questions?

This is the gig where we have at least 5-6 divers out collecting marine critters to place in the beach ""tide pools"" at about 7pm, or so. We collect for an hour-ish. The folks get to see the amazing marine life we divers get to see on our dives. After dark, at about 9pm, we then do a ""live-Dive"" off the beach with a streaming video camera showing on a big screen..right on the beach. Our diver will be using an OTS full face mask with full audio comms so the guests and crew can here the Ranger and the diver describing all the cool stuff that we all know is down there. Over the years that the club has been doing this, we have had as many as 300 people join in on the fun. According to my main point of contact in the Edmonds Parks Dept, we have one of the best attended naturalist events they put on ALL YEAR! We are a big hit! What a great way to help educate people on the wonders of the marine world of Puget Sound. It's all just a few hundred feet off the beach. So...I need help from at least 6 divers and other folks to help us with setting-up the tent, video gear, cables, etc at the Edmonds Marina Beach Park. While I am out of commission, Gene Coronetz will be the diver on comms. I will need one diver to help him drag his comm and video lines along during the live program. We usually get done at about 9:45pm. Then, we have to get all our gear back to the parking lot and stowed away. We will try to be out of the park by 10:30pm. Bring good lights! It's dark on that thar beach. I prefer that we arrive to set-up at about 5pm, or so. That gives us time to do the parking spot shuffle with all the other people using the park. The Edmond Beach Rangers are fantastic! They love it when we do this show. Come on out and have a fun time and help educate the folks about our favorite dive place...Puget Sound.

Turn left onto 12th Street like you are going to the ferry. Go west until you get to the light, about 2.5 miles. A right down the hill takes you to the ferry dock, but go straight on Sunset Ave. Continue west to the sign for Skyline Marina at the bottom of the hill, about half a mile. Turn left (south) and go straight at the stop sign. Continue a few blocks to the Skyline Marina North Island Boat Company signs on your left. Pull into the parking lot. The boat is on TD dock next to the marina office, Slip no. TD-22. The gates will be open and tank carts will be unlocked. Thank you, Bruce Brown 425 334-7763 Home 425 512-7457 Cell"

Although a shallow dive (18-47 ft), there is potential for considerable current. On March 5 predicted, adjusted, slack will be at 8:30 am before a flooding tide. Tide on the flood heads westward, so we'll endeavor to ride the ebbing current into the bridge pylon area around 8:00 or so and then ride it back when the tide turns. Max current on either side of slack max at 1.5knots on that date. So it ought to be manageable. Fischnaller is quite specific that we begin the return swim as soon as the current changes. We will see. Parking is north of the road on Fox Island."

Splash ~ 10:15 Advanced, with some NW current experience (drift dives in Cozumel and the like do not count.) This is a North entrance, north and back dive. Mid-grade current, fine for experienced folks, OK if you have a good number of dives under your belt and are looking to up your current experience a bit. The north drift is shallower and stays closer to shore. I think it is the preferred dive to do as your first dive here. Note on terminology. When I use the term [Advanced] I do not mean PADI/NAUI 'Advanced'. In my opinion getting through 'Advanced Class' is just about a minimum to be exploring Puget Sound at the 'Basic' level. The use of that term for an entry level class is both confusing and counterproductive. Day Island is a serious shore dive and needs to be treated as such. No rescue, no boat pickup. There is no try, you do or you don't do. If you are not sure if this is a dive for you, email or call me. Limited Parking, no facilities, carpooling encouraged.

You can go down and see a section of the old bridge. This consists primarily of concrete structures and grating. There is only one bridge deck left of the two. The remaining plate is some 200' feet long laying in 45' to 80' at the deep end of it. Lots of construction debris around. It's dark when you get near the bridge due to shadows cast by the live bridge above you. The sound the passing cars make over the bridge decking above adds to the surrealness of this dive."

Boat loading time starts at 8:30 AM. Boat departure time is 9:15 AM. Return to the marina around mid-afternoon. Sea Dragon Charters operates out of Sewell’s Marina next to the Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal in West Vancouver, BC. The address for Sewell’s Marina is 6409 Bay Street, Horseshoe Bay, BC, V7V Here is the link to the Sea Dragon Charters (604-329-3486) http://seadragoncharters.com (http://seadragoncharters.com/) The website has descriptions of their charter boat, the Topline, driving directions to Sewell’s Marina, what you can see at their favorite dive sites, etc. My first trip to the marina, two years ago, I used the GPS directions on my Garmin that sent me through downtown Vancouver (very slow). Directions from MapQuest will provide a better route via BC-99N, BC-91 N towards New West Minster, BC-91A N, Marine Way W, etc. Since this trip will be during the winter months, the Topline will be moored near Sewells’s fuel dock, on the west side of the marina (closest to the Bathhouse Restaurant). The Sea Dragon website, under Booking has advisory information about parking and a nice map showing where the Topline is moored November until March. http://seadragoncharters.com/wp-content/uploads/seadragon-horseshoe-bay.pdf Last year, Bruce Brown and I purchased coupons for 10 Sea Dragon 2-tank boat dives in 2015 at $85 US/dive trip. Between the two of us, we have 4 extra coupons that we would like to sell at cost ($85 US) to MBDC members that would like to join us on Sea Dragon’s Nov. 21 dive charter trip. Otherwise, to book a 2-tank boat dive with Sea Dragon Charters today would be $115.45 CDN (tax included). Bruce has three $85 US coupons to sell. I have only one $85 coupon to sell. So please give us a call. Bruce (cell: 425-512-7457), Carl (cell: 425-308-4625). First come, first serve for those four $85 coupons. Beyond the first 6, the Sea Dragon’s Topline should have room for others. However, you will need to pay the higher price, directly to Sea Dragon Charters. On July 22, Bruce and I and two other MBDC members enjoyed a great day on Howe Sound, using the $85 Sea Dragon coupons that we had purchased last year. We dove the Annapolis and a site called Crazy Crab Wall on Bowyer Island. At Sewell’s Marina, you will need a $1 Canadian coin (they call them a “Looni”) to insert into locking system that releases one marina wheelbarrow to haul your dive gear down to the Top Line and for then again for offloading at the end of the day. The marina has about four wheelbarrows to use. The nice thing about this wheelbarrow locking system is that it returns your Looni when you return to the wheelbarrow. You can unload your equipment at the loading zone at the dock. Then you must move your vehicle to a nearby pay lot. Consult their website about parking options. Questions, please contact Carl Baird (425-308-4625, carl.baird@wavecable.com)."

Meet 11:45 AM. Advanced, with some NW current experience (drift dives in Cozumel and the like are just not the same.) This is a North entrance, north and back dive. Mid-grade current, fine for experienced folks, OK if you have a good number of dives under your belt and are looking to up your current experience a bit. The north drift is shallower and stays closer to shore. I think it is the preferred dive to do as your first dive here. I expect the viz to be in the 10-12' range with all the rain. Note on terminology. When I use the term [Advanced] I do not mean PADI/NAUI 'Advanced'. In my opinion getting through 'Advanced Class' is just about a minimum to be exploring Puget Sound at the 'Basic' level. The use of that term for an entry level class is both confusing and counterproductive. Day Island is a serious shore dive and needs to be treated as such. If you are not sure if this is a dive for you, email or call me. Limited Parking, no facilities, carpooling encouraged. Residential neighborhood and we want to keep our impact low and our presence minimal. Hit Steamer's afterward. Fritz 206-525-0736 home 206-370-4720 cell"

We are going N > S and back which puts us deeper, farther from shore, and into the path of the potential out and down current in the south region. You need to have your legs and wits about you. Bring your trowel. Day Island is an exposed shore dive with some significant rewards for those willing to master current. You have a number of different dive options, plus the opportunity to see large wolf eels and GPO. About 125 yards off shore you drop into a small wall area. In this particular dive a dying flood pushes you south. The Day Island Wall forms this direction, gets larger, deeper and farther from shore. There are lots of dens and big critters living in them, especially if you make it all the way to South Bay. No facilities in a normal (OK high end) residential neighborhood. Titlow park has a nice restroom by the water park, or some other businesses nearby for the last pitstop. Since it is a neighborhood carpooling is nice to reduce auto impact.

Scheduled to attend are the Boeing Seahorses, Moss Bay Dive Club and the UW Underdawgs (Go Huskies!) and, of course Marker Buoy Dive Club, plus the latest addition Emerald Sea Dive Club. Rules, you ask? We are using the Helsinki Convention of the International Underwater Pumpkin Carving Rules this year: • Buddy teams for diving and carving. • Any implements can be used as long as they can be sheathed. • BYOP - Bring your own pumpkin. • Pumpkins must be intact prior to carving. Designs may be stenciled on the gourd but the skin cannot be pierced. • Minimum carving depth is 10 feet. Meet at 0830, briefing at 0930, splash at 1000 and all submissions are due on the deck at 1100. Marker Buoy is providing pre-dive goodies and The Seahorses and Moss Bay are doing the post dive refreshments. HINT: Bring a goodie bag and extra weights to help submerge and stabilize your pumpkin. A scholarly article from the October 2014 newsletter offers some insight on this process. Judging is accomplished by recruiting random passers-by so feel free to stack the deck in your favor by encouraging friends and family to come root for your pumpkin. Any questions?

This is a one-day affair, drive up Saturday morning, do TWO dives on the Annapolis and come back the same day. No hotels required. If we can get six people to go, then we get the club discount of 103.95 Canadian (currently $79.81 US). The Annapolis is a Canadian military vessel that was made into an artificial reef in April of this year. Still has that new-wreck smell. The bridge is in about 50 feet of water, the bottom of the rudder is at 110 feet. I've been on this site three times this year; it is suitable for all experienced divers (I would not recommend this for new divers, you want a good SAC rate and good buoyancy control). You ascend and descent along an anchor line; safety stops are not a problem. Only members in good standing with the country of Canada need apply. :) Information about the ship is at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMCS_Annapolis_(DDH_265 ) UPDATE - July 24th: The following link takes you to a depth chart for the Annapolis. http://artificialreef.bc.ca/images/265_Annapolis/Annapolis_Depths.pdf UPDATE - July 31st: Here is a link to where the Sea Dragon Charter is located in the marina (marked with the letter A on this page). In the summer they dock at the east end of the marina and on the west end in the winter. When you enter the parking lot, head east to the end of the lot and unload your gear. http://binged.it/1LVI9CH On your way up, head towards the Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal, but stay to the left and head to ""Horseshoe Bay Village"" (some signs read just ""Village"". You will need to park your car after you unload. Here is some information about parking in Horseshoe Bay Village. http://seadragoncharters.com/wp-content/uploads/seadragon-horseshoe-bay.pdf UPDATE - September 15th I just sent you all an email using the email addresses you have listed on your MBDC Membership pages. If you did not receive an email from me, send a note to me at johndo88@gmail.com and I'll send you a copy. For you two who are bringing a +1, please forward a copy to your friend. For me anyway, October can't come soon enough. :) UPDATE - October 19th For once, Monday is a good day, we'll all be on the Annapolis THIS SATURDAY. By now I hope you all have: 1. Printed and completed a copy of the Assumption of Risk and Release of Liability form. 2. Paid Sea Dragon directly for your spot, making sure that they know that you are a member of the Marker Buoy Dive Club. 3. Have printed out a map or configured your GPS. 4. Understood and collected the documentation you need for a border crossing (e.g., Passport or Enhanced Drivers License). 5. Gotten psyched up what should be a great wreck dive. Cheers John *** IMPORTANT UPDATE *** - October 21st The air compressor on the Topline is down for repairs. Unknown if the parts will be available in time for our dive. Plan on bringing TWO tanks just in case. If they get it fixed at the last minute then we can leave our extra tanks in the car."

The past few years has seen over 300-350 people show-up to learn about what we see as divers. We divers are there to collect and help show/interpret local marine life that we carefully place into ""pools' right at the beach. Working closely with the Beach Rangers, we need teams of divers to get out a few hours before sunset to bring in the cool critters. Just after sunset, we'll do a live streaming video event from just offshore at the Marina Beach Park. Randy Williams will be using a live video cam along with a full face mask to show and comment about what is right offshore. The live show is shown on a big screen right at the beach! The Beach Rangers are the MC's for the show. People come from all over to watch this event. It's a huge hit! here's the link: http://www.edmondswa.gov/calendars/city-calendar/event/344-moonlight-beach-adventure.html We need divers and friends to help collect and to assist with the gear set-up and removal.

Meet at 6:30, in the water when all are ready. Can tailor the dive to the comfort zone of divers that show up, but a typical cruise would be to head out the buoys defining the no-go zone for the ferry, look for GPOs in the usual places, take a depth heading towards the I-Beams (again that depth being determined by who shows up) scanning the silt for Stubby Squid, pop down to the I-Beams to see what treasures are at the end, then up to the plumose covered pilings near what used to be the Honey Bear wreck. We typically find a few Decorated Warbonnets there, often fully out. Then swim back to the entrance with a long and interesting safety stop. For your convenience, have arranged for the tide to be high for an extremely easy entrance and exit. The park has bathrooms, and a shower to rinse gear. Parking however? That's the toughest part.

Features Small Wreck, Debris, Structures, Description This is the most popular of the Alki dive sites and an all-around great dive park. It is protected from major current and has lots of life in shallow water. If you are on the beach looking out there is a boat just inside the marker line at about 45ft. To the right you can find a decent sized boat called the Honey Bear in about 35 ft, near the base of a bunch of pilings that are angled out of the bottom. Several other piles of boulders and Pilings are scattered around this site. More experienced divers can venture to deeper depths to see the I-beams. Follow the rope under the buoy line to about 85 ft where it starts to turn North (to the left). Turn Right and hold that depth and you'll come across them quickly. There are a couple other small sunken boats and piles of rocks that are interesting to see on the way. Special Restrictions: You MUST stay outside of the buoy line. This is an active ferry/water taxi dock. There is a rope on the bottom with some bottles floating on it that marks the buoy line so that you can avoid crossing it. How to get there: From Seattle, take the west Seattle bridge to the Harbor Ave SW Exit and take a right on Harbor Ave SW. Follow it 1.3 miles along the water until you come to the fish-n-chips restaurant and the water taxi parking lot. You can either park in the lot or on the street.

Medium exchange but a LONG swim in current with nothing but a compass and judgement to orient you. This can be very disorienting. The exposure to current is significant. That's why it's an advanced site. Drift from the south entrance to the north entrance, or just go out and back, your choice but you should be ready to change your decision based on conditions. This is often necessary and adds to the complexity of the dive. This is the most difficult profile on DIW due to the long swim, exposure to current and depth. You definitely want current experience and be comfortable with long swims on an exposed shelf. There is nothing to grab onto. I sometimes bring a plastic garden trowel. There is no boat to rescue you. You have to be competent to deal with the hazards this dive provides and respond in a safe way to them. If you are thinking, ""Yeah, I'd like to gain some current experience"", > don't come. You already NEED current experience to do this.

It brings you down toward South Bay where there is a potential for down and out current, in this case a stiff one. Not a good situation to be in.

When I use the term [Advanced] I do not mean PADI/NAUI 'Advanced'. In my opinion getting through 'Advanced Class' is just about a minimum to be exploring Puget Sound at the 'Basic' level.

Northwest Shore Dives says that if divers splash 30 minutes before the slack before flood at The Narrows (11:31 AM slack before flood minus 30 minutes = an 11:01 AM splash), they can drift south with the current to the rock ledge. Current direction at Sunrise, shortly after flood begins at The Narrows, will then start flowing northward, carrying divers back to the entry point. For this particular dive I think it would be best for divers who are familiar with Sunrise and who are comfortable with current to attend. The currents at The Narrows aren't particularly strong: going from a -2.1 ebb to a 2.3 flood. As always, there's quite a hill to contend with, and facilities include ample parking, one picnic bench, and a porta-potty."

Tides/currents are favorable for splash about 1030 or so and perhaps later. Alcohol is allowed only in the campground, by registered campers of legal age. It is not allowed in any other areas of the park. They asked me to tell you that. And parking is by permit only, so you need either a current Discover Pass or a day-use permit ($10.00). We have reserved the Beach Point Fire Ring, which supplies us with 4 picnic tables and some concrete benches. The location is just to the right from the southern-most parking lot, across the creek from the scuba rinse station. It's easy to find as you will certainly see our MBDC banner and masses of dive gear strewn about. Restrooms are located about 150 feet away from our site. What should you bring? Dive gear, chairs, something to grill and something to share for the potluck. A couple of pop-ups (portable canopy tents i.e. quick-ups) would be greatly appreciated as well. The site does NOT provide us with a grill so two or three BBQ grills would be wonderful so we can cook. I'll bring a grill, set of BBQ cooking tools and some charcoal and a chimney starter.

It is common to see Puget Sound King Crab and various anenomies. Good for photography. Occasionally we will see ling cod and octopus. Wolf eels have been spotted but you need to look for them in the cracks and crevices. The price is $90 per person and must be paid in advance. The dives include breakfast snacks, lunch, coffee, tea and bottled water. Lu-Jac's web site is http://www.lujacsquest.com for more information and directions to the boat. The boat will departure from the Anacortes dock at 9:30 AM but everyone should be to the boat at 9:00 AM so we can load all the gear and leave promptly by 9:30 AM. Expect to return about 4:00 PM. The dives include breakfast snacks, lunch, coffee, tea and bottled water. Cost is $90.00.

We currently have 9 slots filled and need another 3 to round out the boat. The Swell is a beautiful craft and diving off her is a blast. Here is the website; http://www.nautilusswell.com/ Note, this trip is not advertised on the site. We are looking at trip leaving Anacortes on 4/6/2014 and returning on 4/10/2014. Boarding in Anacortes is Sunday night at 8:00PM and it disembarks Thursday morning at 8:30 AM. That means we would be diving 4/7 to 4/9 but some of us are talking about adding some dives on the 10th. There would be an up-charge for this and it would be something the entire group needs to agree upon. I do not have pricing but it will be competitive. Since we have the entire boat booked the itinerary is very much up to the group and the weather and tides. Current talk is centering on the San Juan Islands, Neah Bay and Victoria. Here are the details from Mike: MB quiet pricing would be $8100 per trip which works out to $675 per person. Retail pricing through dive stores or on our website is $799 for stateroom accommodation and $999 for superior suites. Pricing includes everything with the exception of $35 port fee, bar, gift shop and nitrox and crew gratuities. Mid-week trips typically board at 8:00 pm on Sunday evenings and disembark at 8:30 a.m. Thursday morning. I need to stress that this trip is for advanced divers only. If you are interested you should be comfortable and able to: 1. Dive in current and surge. 2. Dive in an open ocean environment off a smaller boat. The Swell carries a tender that acts as a dive boat. it is 38 feet long though. 3. Carry and use an SMB in the event you get blown off a site. 4. Manage 3 dives a day to depths below 80fsw. Nitrox is available and highly recommended. To make this a go we need people who are committed to the trip. Please only RSVP if you are absolutely sure you can go. Payment will be needed very soon. If you have questions please post a comment or email me."

The Scuba & H2O Adventure Show is coming to Seattle on April 5 and 6, 2014. The 7th annual event is moving to Seattle’s Pier 91 and combining all kinds of watersports and adventure for a fun mix of events, exhibits and entertainment. The Scuba & H2O Adventure Show (www.scubaH2Oshow.com) will = feature over 150 exhibitors from around the globe: prominent travel experts, consumer mini-clinics, interactive family-friendly activities, and industry focuses trade events. “Strategically located in the heart of Seattle’s downtown core, on Pier 91, this event is perfectly located for fun,” says event producer and DNN CEO Rick Stratton. “Our attendees have an appetite for travel adventure and water sports and this show is a great way to experience all there is to offer in one day. We are very excited about our partnerships within the city of Seattle. Being located on Pier 91 is the perfect way to access this water loving community.” Over 150 exhibitors representing some of the world’s most desired locations will be on hand to entice, educate and give details about their destinations and tours to attendees, including Fiji, Philippines, Mexico, Alaska, Palau, Bahamas, and popular Caribbean destinations. “Many of these destinations are offering incredible specials and trip giveaways. Our Grand Prize will be a trip to a beautiful resort in Fiji with Airfare – simply incredible,” says Stratton. Guests will enjoy all kinds of interactive demonstrations including a SCUBA demo pool, paddling demos, stand-up paddle boarding (SUP) demos and even SUP yoga demonstration. The shows invites guests to attend show floor seminars to learn about gear, safety, travel, and of course, try new water sports. Meet all kinds of specialty retailers, manufacturers and travel experts from around the corner and across the globe. Located on the northern end of Elliott Bay, Pier 91 is known as Smith Cove and is less than three miles from the downtown core. Smith Cove is home to the Cruise Ship Terminal and cruise lines like Carnival, Celebrity Cruises, Holland America, Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean International. No matter the motivation, the draw to water sports is perhaps best described as a desire to connect with the ocean and discover something new. With the number of water sports available it wouldn’t be surprising to find equally numbered retailers, and manufacturers appealing to the love of water. What is surprising, however, is how easy it is to find all of them in one place! There are so many water adventures to choose from: whether in need of a tranquil afternoon on the kayak or seeking a heart-pounding thrill ride with white water rafting, guests can find their desire at the SCUBA & H2O Show this coming April. Sign up for Adventure and WIN great prizes!

We have applied for permits from the Mexican government to dive or snorkel with the whales as part of an article on their migration. This would be a seven day trip, and would include room, lodging, and transportation round trip from La Paz. The higher cost would be for permits to dive or snorkel with the whales.

This dive site is perfect for you. This is a fresh water lake with crystal clear waters and no pesky tide chart to contend with. There are a few well known dive sites in this lake. Most are below 100’, but we will be visiting the sunken barge. Because of the visibility, you do have to remain aware of your depth because you can go really deep without realizing it. But all and all a good dive to contrast what you typically see in the Puget Sound. Bring your camera and work on your wide angle shots. Meetup time of 10:30am is based on catching the 7:55am Edmonds /Kingston ferry and a 2 hour dive. Mapquest sez the trip should take an hour forty. That gives a little wiggle room for finding lunch and what not. We will be meeting and diving around the swimming area, which is closed to scuba from May 1 to September 30. I don’t have much more info as I have not been on this site in a while. The splash time will be at 11:00am, but this is flexible as the tides are favorable. (yuck,yuck) If interest in this dive is early and vocal enough, we could turn this into an overnight event and dive a site on the coast near Port Angeles.

It starts shallow on a steep rock face covered with invertebrate life, the highlight of this dive. When it's good it's very pretty indeed with lots of sea cucumbers and sponges. This is a place to see occasional candy stripe shrimp and PS King Crabs if you have good eyes and are lucky. As you travel out it gets deeper to ~ 95 feet. No need to go deeper if you don't want to. No facilities on site, stop at Anacortes or WA Park before you arrive. We have been using 'weed side' parking for several years. Building going on up there may have compromised the parking. It's a 90 minute drive from north Seattle. Because of both these factors carpooling is strongly recommended. We usually hit up the Brown Lantern in town after the dive for grub."

Identical profile to Dec 15th which worked well. Current was present but modest. Meet 1:30, splash about 2:30. This should be OK for folks with some experience with DIW and not put off by a long swim in current. It's ~200 yards out....and back if you do the return. It's probably 400+ yards of swimming if you do the drift. Several of us did not drift, just went out and back. That's a nice profile with more time to explore South Bay. The down side is being deeper longer (60-90 feet) so it sucks down your tank and runs up your N2. Drifting gets you closer to shore and shallower. Leave yourself a bit of extra time to move vehicles if you expect to do the drift and don't want to hump your tank back.

In the late 1950's and early 1960's Bill introduced and promoted diving to numerous marine science agencies that had not yet learned of the merits and value of scuba as a research tool. He served as the national diving officer for both the US Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and the National Marine Fisheries Service as well as NOAA's first National Diving Coordinator. Bill wrote the first scientific diving regulations for each agency.

Notice that Franklin Lane ends near the beach. THAT's where we're going. We can offload our gear within 200 feet of the beach, then park up above in the lot... 3) If you are coming from the Keystone Ferry, follow Hi 525 south and turn right at the traffic light onto Cultus Bay Road. From the Clinton Ferry, Take a left onto Campbell Rd, then left again onto Cultus Bay Road to cut several unnecessary miles off of your drive. This road becomes Possession Point Road at the 90 degree left curve at the top (north) end of Cultus Bay... Proceed east and PP Road will turn 90 degrees to the right (south) at the intersection with Brockman, (which you will be on if you continue straight ahead... DON'T go there!) Follow PP Road south and you will arrive at a 180 degree switchback... Proceed ahead and you will arrive at Franklin Lane, AND the entrance to Possession Point COUNTY Park. Watch the signs carefully and take Franklin, which is the FIRST right turn you can make after the switchback... Keep to the right and you will arrive at the end of the road where the STATE PARK parking lot is located... This is where you will park AFTER you continue on past the sign that states ""Authorized vehicles only beyond this point""... You'll wind down a narrow lane and arrive at the Ranger's white house... take the driveway to the right toward the wood shed... The driveway ends there and this is where you will off load your gear... 4) The ""dive gate"" actually opens at about 7:30 AM at the ebb slack; so, if you are familiar with this site and want an early start, take the 6:00 or 6:30 ferry from Mukelteo and you can be diving by 7:30 or 8:00... That's not for me! I'll be on the 9:00 Boat and diving by 10:30- 11:00. The flood slack occurs at about 5:30, so you'll want to be wrapped up by 5:00 or so... 5) 2 dives are practical during that time frame... or you can do one and then hang out and explore this little gem of a park... 6) I'll be available to new divers/ divers new to the area for a pre-dive orientation and will act as a guide on the first dive for any who might be interested in that opportunity... 7) New divers: remember that good buoyancy control is important here: please try not to touch the vertical clay walls over much; you might dislodge a rock that could hit a diver below you... 8) Photographers, explorers, ""funsters""; You're gonna love this dive! Fabulous geology & sea life on display; be sure to explore all of the nooks and crannies that are here... 9) There is one plastic commode on site near the beach and more commodious restrooms at the adjoining county park (at that previously mentioned intersection after the switchback) 10) Bring a picnic as the nearest place to find food is back at Clinton 11) I will have 1 10x10 shade structure; but you might want to bring your own, and some camp chairs too...

No facilities on site, stop at Anacortes or Wa Park before you arrive. We have been using 'weed side' parking for several years. Building going on up there may have compromised the parking. It's a 90 minute drive from north Seattle. Because of both these factors carpooling is strongly recommended. We usually hit up the Brown Lantern in town after the dive for grub.

We have three resident octopus right out front and while this dive is less fishy, there is still lots to see as we work our way up to Point Glover fingers.

Lawn chairs are also a great idea. If you just coming for the planning party / BBQ come anytime and just hang out. Non-divers are welcome. There's lots of room to lounge outside or down at the beach. Or take a kayak out for a paddle. Parking is limited so car pooling is recommended. The ferry schedule can be found here (http://www.wsdot.com/Ferries/Schedule/ScheduleDetail.aspx?tripdate=20130616&departingterm=9&arrivingterm=20&roundtrip=true).

The presentation will focus how scientists measure and discuss sound, how sound can be used to study the ocean, what sources of sound exist in the ocean, and why noise in the ocean matters. To do this I will focus on data and results from studies in Puget Sound. Following the presentation he will be happy to (try) answer any questions you have."

Well, Lads, I am sad to say that the weather gods do not want us to do this dive tomorrow. Let's save it for a time when wind and waves abate adequately. If anyone NEEDS to dive tomorrow, we can throw in with the gang @ Redondo... Gene The weather forecast is not looking good for Saturday , with SSW winds to 16Kt predicted. That means waves; lots of 'em... Sunday looks much better right now. My preference is to stick with Lowman Beach, but we could switch to Blakely Rocks if the wind sticks around on Sunday... Note that we'll meet a little later on Sunday, as the slack is about 3:30PM. Let me know your preferences... Gene This dive is advanced due to the distance over open water and the large tide exchange. There will be current, and divers must have already demonstrated to me their ability to: right a capsized boat Manage their gear so as not to lose it & be able to load it back in your boat (by the way, your integrated weight BC MUST float without you in it!) exit & re-enter the boat, don & doff their gear in the water manage to dive while towing their boat Right now, I'm expecting rain. If it turns out that Sunday looks like better weather, I might change to that. Should know a lot more by Thursday evening... Standby! IF the wind comes up (over 7 kt) This little exercise will be cancelled. Big choppy waves while diving from kayaks is not a good combination Gene Beautiful anemone covered artificial boulder reef with LOT's of fish to see: We'll paddle our kayaks from Lowman Beach North on the ebb tide to the site; dive through the slack (about 3:00 PM) & return on the flood to the park..."
